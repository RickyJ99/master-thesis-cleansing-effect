\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {3.2}{\ignorespaces The phase diagram demonstrates the evolution of capital in a debt-free scenario, with the dynamics dictated by the specific parameters: depreciation rate (\(\delta =0.1\)), capital's output elasticity (\(\alpha = 0.8\)), total factor productivity (\( Z= 0.5\)), and fixed dividends (\(d = 0.8\)). The blue trajectory line depicts the capital accumulation process, calculated with the formula \( k_{t+1} = 0.5 \cdot k_{t}^{0.8} - 0.1 \cdot k_{t} + k_{t} - 0.8 \), which captures the interplay between capital growth through production, the diminishing returns as capital increases (reflected by the concavity of the curve), and the outflow due to depreciation and dividends. The steady-state capital (\(\setbox \z@ \hbox {\mathsurround \z@ $\textstyle k$}\mathaccent "0362{k}\)), marked by a red dot, indicates the level where the economy naturally gravitates over time. At this point, the firm's investment is precisely calibrated to replace depreciated capital and issue dividends, with no additional net investment. Notably, this equilibrium is a focal point of the system; below this level, capital accumulates, and above it, capital stock adjusts downward, converging back to this stable point. The diagram serves as a visual aid to comprehend capital dynamics within this economic framework and underscores the balancing act between production, depreciation, and dividend distribution in long-term capital management. }}{47}{figure.3.2}\protected@file@percent }

The intersection point B on the red curve indicates the equilibrium for Firm 0 where both capital and dividends are stationary, located at (\(7.25, 0.9\)). In contrast, the intersection point \(B'\) on the blue curve represents the corresponding equilibrium for Firm 1 with monitoring costs, positioned at (\(2.5, 0.28\)). It is evident that Firm 1, which bears monitoring costs, sustains lower dividends while keeping capital constant, and also requires a lower level of capital to maintain constant dividends when compared to Firm 0}{figure.4.3}{}}

Both scenarios are subject to 15\% monitoring costs and experience a sinusoidal continuous shock affecting productivity. The visualization illustrates that the incorporation of exit and reallocation strategies enhances the overall output of the economy despite the presence of financial frictions. Given that the total number of firms is held constant at ten, the aggregate production can be interpreted as average productivity by dividing by ten. The data suggest the presence of a cleansing effect within the economy, even when financial frictions are factored in.
