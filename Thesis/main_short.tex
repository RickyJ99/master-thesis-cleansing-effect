\begin{abstract}
    This thesis develops a theoretical framework to explore how financial frictions affect firm's decision on the optimal trajectory for
    capital and dividends. Initially, the model excludes the possibility of debt financing for investment, akin to
    the Ramsey-Cass-Koopmans model, with dividends instead of consumption levels. By employing a Lagrangian method,
    the Euler equation for dividends is derived. In the next stage, firms are allowed to finance investments through
    debt and retained earnings. The model introduces asymmetric information via monitoring costs included in the
    participation constraint of financial intermediaries. Additionally, a borrowing constraint that sets a fixed
    leverage ratio for firms represents another financial friction. The solution process starts with a Lagrangian
    approach to formulate the Euler equations for dividends, followed by a Bellman equation with a
    guess-and-verify method to derive a closed-form solution for the optimal paths of dividends and capital. An
    important finding is that monitoring costs lead to lower steady-state levels of capital and dividends. The thesis concludes
    with Monte Carlo simulations that introduce heterogeneity across firms and continuous sinusoidal productivity shocks.
    These simulations suggest that financial frictions reduce the cleansing effect of recession, but the latter remains positively
    significant, aligning with the findings of \cite{OsePap17}.

\chapter{The Firm's Problem}
\section{Introduction}
This thesis presents a partial equilibrium model in which firms maximize dividends over an infinite period, under financial frictions,
investigating how those frictions can affect the saddle path of capital and dividends. Compared to \cite{OsePap17} and
\cite{CabHarm94}, this
model allows us to find a closed-form solution optimal path for dividends and capital.
The subsequent sections delve into the formulation of the flow of funds and its dynamics. Following this, the focus
shifts to scenarios  where financial frictions are present, examining their
implications on firm behavior and market outcomes.

\chapter{Optimization under Financial Frictions}
This chapter delves into a firm's optimization in a context where debt financing is entwined with financial frictions.
We dissect two pivotal constraints:

The fixed leverage constraint restricts a firm's debt-to-equity ratio, thereby shaping its capital structure and
investment choices. This fixed ratio (\(0<l<1\)), where \(b_t = l k_t\), is enforced to mitigate default risk. It
remains invariant over time, disallowing leverage adjustment in response to productivity shocks, thereby reducing the
optimization problem to capital and dividend decisions. 

We also explore the participation constraint with monitoring costs for financial intermediaries. These intermediaries
incur costs to ensure borrowers' compliance and solvency, influencing the cost of borrowing and affecting loan terms
and credit access.

Incorporating these frictions, the model aims to mirror the real-world financial conditions of firms. We investigate the
impact of these frictions on firms' steady-state behavior, particularly on capital and dividend dynamics, vital for
understanding the broader economic impact of financial frictions. 

Following the analysis of participation constraints, we address the firm's maximization problem in the face of financial
frictions. Using a Lagrangian formulation, we determine the stationary conditions for dividends and capital, visualized
in a phase diagram. The firm's problem is then reformulated via a Bellman equation and solved using iterative
techniques. 

The chapter concludes with Monte Carlo simulations to model firm heterogeneity in leverage and productivity,
incorporating continuous productivity shocks and an exit condition based on a return on capital threshold. This exit
mechanism serves as a test of the 'cleansing effect' on the economy's output, both with and without monitoring costs, to
determine if a cleansing effect persists in the presence of financial frictions. 
\section{Participation constraint of the financial intermediaries } 
The subsection delves into the constraints facing financial intermediaries within the model. Initially, the model assumed an exogenous
interest rate, unaffected by the volume of debt, leading to an unrealistic scenario where interest rates remain
constant.  To address this,  the model incorporates a financial market in which the interest rate is set based on
market-clearing conditions, with financial intermediaries functioning in a perfectly competitive environment aimed at
profit maximization. 

According to \cite{BerGer86}, lending should yield a profit equivalent to the opportunity cost. Lenders earn
interest plus the principal if borrowers repay successfully (with probability \(p\)) or acquire the firm's production
assets (net of monitoring cost: \(1-\mu\)) in case of bankruptcy. Moreover, \((1-\mu)f(k_t)\)represents monitoring cost.
The lender's participation constraint is:
\begin{align*}
    R_t \cdot b_t p + (1-p) \mu f(k_t) = R_f b_t, \
\end{align*}

where \(R_f\) represents the risk-free rate, the opportunity cost of lending. This framework allows for the derivation
of the interest rate as a function of \(p\),\(f(k_t)\),\(\mu\),\(b_t\), and \(R_f\).

The participation constraint can be rewritten as:
\begin{align}
    R_t=\frac{R_f}{p}  -\frac{ 1-p }{ p }\frac{\mu f(k_t)}{b_t}. \label{eq21}
\end{align}

Investigating the asymptotic behavior of \( R_t \) with respect to \( p \) provides critical economic insights.
Specifically, as \( p \rightarrow 0 \), indicating an increasingly likely default, \( R_t \) escalates without bound,
reflecting the infinitely rising premium a lender would require to counterbalance the heightened risk. Conversely, as \(
p \rightarrow 1 \), the default risk vanishes, and \( R_t \) converges to \( R_f \), the risk-free rate, consonant with
the absence of default risk necessitating no premium above the risk-free return. 
When examining the behavior of the interest rate formula as the debt amount \(b_t\) trends towards infinity, the resulting limit is given by:

\[
\lim_{{b_t \rightarrow +\infty}} \frac{R_f}{p} - \frac{1-p}{p}\frac{\mu f(k_t)}{b_t} = \frac{R_f}{p}
\]

As the denominator \(b_t\), representing the total
debt, increases without bound, the term involving the firm's productive output adjusted for recovery rate (\(\mu
f(k_t)/b_t\)) diminishes to zero. This indicates that, in scenarios of very large debt volumes, the fraction of
recoverable assets (\(\mu f(k_t)\)) compared to the outstanding debt becomes negligible in determining the interest rate
\(R_t\).

Therefore, under such conditions, the interest rate formula simplifies to \(\frac{R_f}{p}\), underscoring that the
loan's interest rate is fundamentally determined by the risk-free rate adjusted for the probability of successful
repayment \(p\), independent of the firm's asset recoverability or productivity levels. This elucidates an important
economic principle: for vast sums of debt, the critical factors shaping lending rates pivot away from the specifics of
asset recovery towards broader financial metricsâ€”namely, the prevailing risk-free rate and the inherent risk of default.






\section{The problem of the firm in the presence of financial frictions}
 The firm's objective is to maximize:

\[
\max_{{\{d_{t}\}}_{t=0}^{+\infty}}V_0 = \sum_{t=0}^{+\infty}{\beta^t U(d_t)}
\]

subject to:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the flow of funds constraint: \(I_t + R b_{t} + d_t = f(k_t) + b_{t+1}\)
    \item the investment function \(I_t = k_{t+1} - k_{t}\left(1-\delta\right)\) 
    \item the financing constraint \(b_t=l k_t\)
    \item the participation constraint of lenders \(R_t=\frac{R_f}{p}  -\frac{ 1-p }{ p }\frac{\mu f(k_t)}{b_t}\)
\end{enumerate}
Consolidating the constraints we get the flow of funds constraints:
\begin{align}
    k_{t+1} &= \left\{k_{t}(1 - \delta) - \left[\frac{R_f}{p}  -\frac{ 1-p }{ p }\frac{\mu f(k_{t})}{l  k_{t}}\right] \cdot l k_{t} + f(k_{t}) - d_{t} \right \}{\left(1-l\right)}^{-1} \nonumber \\
    k_{t+1} &= \left[ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{t}) + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{t}  - d_{t} \right](1-l)^{-1} \label{eq:ff}
\end{align}

The Lagrangian for this optimization problem is :

\begin{align}
L=\sum_{t=0}^{+\infty}\beta^t U(d_t) - \beta^t \lambda_t\left[ k_{t+1} - \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{t}) - \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{t}  + d_{t} \right](1-l)^{-1},
\end{align}

leading to the first-order conditions for optimizing dividends and capital over time:


\begin{align}
    U'(d_t) &= \frac{\lambda_t}{\left(1-l\right)}, \quad \forall t,
\end{align}


and the dynamic optimality conditions for capital allocation:


\begin{align}
    \lambda_t = \beta \frac{\lambda_{t+1}}{\left(1-l\right)} \left[ f'(k_{t})\frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p} + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} \right], \quad \forall t.
\end{align}


This formulation yields the Euler equation for dividends:

\begin{align}
U^{\prime}(d_{t})=\frac{\beta}{\left(1-l\right)} U^{\prime}(d_{t+1})\left[ f'(k_{t})\frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p} + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} \right],
\end{align}

imposing (\(d_t = d_{t+1} =\hat{d}\)), we get:

\begin{align}
    \frac{\left(1-l \right) p}{\beta} &= f^{\prime}(\hat{k})\left({p+\mu-\mu p}\right) + \left({p-\delta p - R_f l}\right) \nonumber\\
    f^{\prime}(\hat{k})&=\frac{p -p l - \beta p + \beta \delta p + \beta R_f l}{\beta \left(p+\mu-\mu p\right)} \label{eq22}
\end{align}
using the Cobb Douglas production function \ref{eq15'} into \ref{eq22} we get:
\begin{align}
    Z \alpha\hat{k}^{\alpha-1} &= \frac{p -p l - \beta p + \beta \delta p + \beta R_f l}{\beta \left(p+\mu-\mu p\right)} \nonumber \\
    \hat{k} &=\left[\frac{Z \alpha \beta \left(p+\mu-\mu p\right)}{p -p l - \beta p + \beta \delta p + \beta R_f l}\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}} \label{eq23}
\end{align}
Similar to the scenario without debt, when the firm's capital falls below the steady-state threshold \( \hat{k} \), it
is advantageous for the firm to raise its dividend payouts over time. Conversely, when the firm's capital
surpasses \( \hat{k} \), it would be more beneficial for the firm to gradually reduce dividends. It can be readily
demonstrated that when monitoring costs become entirely ineffective (\(1-\mu=0\)), the firm operates without debt
(\(l=0\)), and the probability of default is eliminated (\(1-p=0\)), the resulting capital level aligns with that of the
debt-free situation as specified in equation \ref{eq16}: 
\begin{align*}
    \hat{k} &=\left[\frac{Z \alpha \beta \left(1+1-1\right)}{1 -0 - \beta + \beta \delta + 0}\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}},\\
    \hat{k} &=\left[\frac{Z \alpha \beta}{1 - \beta(1-\delta)}\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}.  
\end{align*}

Imposing s.s. condition for capital (\(k_t=k_{t+1}=\hat{k}\)) into the flow of funds constraint \ref{eq:ff}:

\begin{equation}
    \widehat{d} =\frac{p+\mu-\mu p}{p}f(\hat{k})-\left(\frac{l R_f+\delta p - l p}{p}\right)\hat{k} \label{eq:div_opt_path}
\end{equation}
It can be straightforwardly demonstrated that by setting the monitoring cost to \(1-\mu=0\), eliminating debt
with \(l=0\), and removing the risk of default by setting \(1-p=0\), we arrive at an identical level of dividends as
observed in the scenario without debt \ref{eq17}. 



\section{Phase diagram}
The goal of this section is to portray the phase diagram in two cases: one with monitoring costs and one without.
However, we will use a less heuristic approach compared to the phase diagram of the free debt case, using  parameters similar to \cite{OsePap17}:
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \hline Parameter & Symbol & Value \\
    \hline \hline
    Discount factor & $\beta$ & 0.956 \\
    Risk-free rate & $R_f$ & 1.04 \\
    Depreciation rate & $\delta$ & 0.07 \\
    Returns to scale & $\alpha$ & 0.80 \\
    Aggregate productivity & $\bar{Z}$ & 0.5 \\
    Monitoring cost & $1-\mu$ & ${0,0.75}$ \\
    Productivity &$Z$&$0.2$\\
    Probability of default & $1-p $&0.6 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Parameters}
\end{table}
Moreover, we assume a fixed leverage of \(l=0.8\), since for the moment we want to understand the effect of monitoring
cost leaving all the other parameters equal.

The phase diagram illustrated in \ref{pl_phase_b} depicts the capital accumulation dynamics under scenarios of fixed
leverage and varying monitoring costs. While the overall dynamics remain consistent across both scenarios, the
equilibrium capital level is notably reduced in firms that incur monitoring costs, in contrast to those without such
costs. As a result, firms with monitoring costs settle into a steady state equilibrium for dividends, which
leads to diminished dividend distributions compared to firms that do not bear these costs. 

\section{Finding the optimal path}
 Addressing the dynamic optimization problem with an initial condition \(k_0\), we employ a logarithmic utility function
 and frame the issue through a Bellman equation:


 \begin{align*}
     \max _{\{d_t\}_{t=0}^{\infty}} V_0 = \max _{\{d_t\}_{t=0}^{\infty}} \left\{U(d_0) + \beta \left[\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} \beta^{t-1} U(d_t)\right]\right\}
 \end{align*}


 subject to a dynamic capital accumulation constraint:

 \begin{align*}
    k_{t+1} &= \left[ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{t}) + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{t}  - d_{t} \right] \cdot \left(1-l\right)^{-1} \, \forall t,
\end{align*}

 The aim is to determine the optimal dividend strategy \(d_t^*\) and the consequent capital levels \(k_{t+1}^*\) across
 all periods. The optimal policy \(d_t^{\star}=\varphi(k_t)\) links dividends and capital in a time-invariant manner, deduced from the
 constraint:
 \begin{align*}
    k_{t+1} &= \left[ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{t}) + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{t}  - \varphi(k_{t}) \right] \cdot \left(1-l\right)^{-1} 
\end{align*}
 Given the continuous and differentiable nature of capital and dividends, the optimal dividend path can be represented as
 a function of initial capital, thereby defining the maximum value function \(V(k_1)\) in terms of overall utility
 maximization. The revised problem formulation becomes:


 \begin{align}
     & V(k_0) = \max_{d_0} \left\{U(d_0) + \beta V(k_1)\right\} \\
     & \text{s.t. } k_1 = \left[ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{0}) + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{0}  - \varphi(k_{0}) \right] \cdot \left(1-l\right)^{-1} \nonumber  \\
     & k_0 \text{ given.} \nonumber
 \end{align}

 The method of 'guess and verify' involves working through the
 transition equation defined as:
 \begin{align*}
     k_1 = \left[ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{0}) + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{0}  - d^*_0 \right] \cdot \left(1-l\right)^{-1}
 \end{align*}
The first order condition (FOC) is specified as \(d^*_0 = [\beta V'(k_{1})]^{-1}\). When this
 FOC is incorporated into the transition equation, the formulation of the problem becomes a system of equations outlined
 as follows:
 \begin{align*}
     \begin{cases}
         V(k_0) = U(d_0^*) + \beta V(k_1), \\
         k_1 = \left[ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{0}) + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{0}  - d^*_0 \right] \cdot \left(1-l\right)^{-1}, \\
         d^*_0 = [\beta V'(k_{1})]^{-1},\\
         k_0 \text{ given.}
     \end{cases}
 \end{align*}
The initial guess for the solution is:

 \begin{align*}
     V(k_t) = e + f \ln{k_t},
 \end{align*}


leading to a refined system:


 \begin{align}
    &e + f \ln(k_0) = \ln\left( \frac{k_1}{\beta f} \right) + \beta \left[ e + f \ln(k_1) \right] \label{eq28}\\
    &k_1 = \left\{ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{0}) + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{0} - \left[ \frac{k_1}{\beta f} \right] \right\} \cdot \left(1-l\right)^{-1}. \nonumber
\end{align}
Solving the above system we find:
\begin{align}
    k_1 = \frac{\beta f}{\beta f (1-l) + 1} \left( \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{0}) + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{0} \right)
\end{align}

Using \(d_0^*=k_1(\beta f)^{-1}\) in the above equation we get:
\begin{align}
    d_1 =\frac{1}{\beta f (1-l)+1}\left\{ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}f(k_{0}) + \frac{p - \delta p - R_f l}{p} k_{0}\right\}
\end{align}
Assuming \(p - \delta p - R_f l = 0\), and using the Cobb-Douglas production function \ref{eq7}simplifies to:
\begin{align*}
    &k_1 = \frac{\beta f}{\beta f (1-l)+1}\left\{ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}Z k_0^{\alpha}\right\}\\
    &d_1 =\frac{1}{\beta f (1-l)+1}\left\{  \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}Z k_0^{\alpha}\right\}\\
    &e + f \ln(k_0) = \ln \left\{ \frac{1}{\beta f (1-l)+1}\left\{ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}Z k_0^{\alpha}\right\}\right\} \nonumber \\
    &\quad + \beta \left\{ e + f \ln \left[ \frac{\beta f}{\beta f (1-l)+1}\left(  \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}Z k_0^{\alpha}\right)\right]  \right\},\\
    &e + f \ln(k_0) = -\ln{(1+(1-l)\beta f)} + \ln{(p + \mu - \mu p)} - \ln{p} +\\
    &+({\alpha}\ln{Z} + {\alpha}\ln{k_0}) + \beta e - \beta f \ln{(1+(1-l)\beta f)} +\\
    &+\beta f \ln{(p + \mu - \mu p)} - \beta f \ln{p} +\beta f \ln{(\beta f)}+ \beta f ({\alpha}\ln{Z} + {\alpha}\ln{k_0})
\end{align*}
The above equation must be satisfied for any \(k_0\) and for any admissible value of the parameters \(Z, \beta, \alpha,
\mu, p, R_f,l\). Therefore, must be true that:
\begin{align}
    &f = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha \beta} \label{eq30}\\
    &e = \left[ -\ln(1+(1-l)\beta f) + \ln(p + \mu - \mu p) - \ln(p) \right.\nonumber\\
    &\quad + \alpha\ln(Z) - \beta f \ln(1+(1-l)\beta f) \nonumber\\
    &\quad \left. + \beta f \ln(p + \mu - \mu p) - \beta f \ln(p) + \beta f (\alpha\ln(Z)) +\beta f \ln{(\beta f)} \right](1-\beta)^{-1}\nonumber
\end{align}


Therefore, the transition and policy functions under financial frictions can be articulated as follows:
\begin{equation}
    k_1 = \left[ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}Z k_0^{\alpha}\right] \frac{\alpha\beta}{1-l\alpha\beta}, \label{eq29}
\end{equation}
Utilizing \(d^*_0 = k_1(\beta f)^{-1}\) and in conjunction with \ref{eq30}, we can deduce:
\begin{equation}
    d^*_0 = \left[ \frac{p + \mu - \mu p}{p}Z k_0^{\alpha}\right] \frac{1-\alpha\beta}{1-l\alpha\beta} \label{eq31},
\end{equation}
By setting \(k_1 = k_0 = \hat{k}\) in \ref{eq29}, the equation simplifies to:
\begin{equation}
    \hat{k} = \left(\frac{Z \alpha \beta (p + \mu - \mu p)}{p(1 - \alpha \beta l)}\right)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}} \label{eq33}
\end{equation}
This expression elucidates the steady-state capital level, \(\hat{k}\), in relation to the parameters \(\alpha\), \(\beta\), \(l\), \(p\), \(\mu\), and \(Z\).

Taking the derivation of \(\hat{k}\) with respect to \(\mu\) we get:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial \hat{k}}{\partial \mu}&=\frac{1}{1-\alpha}\left(\frac{Z\alpha\beta(p(1-\mu) + u)}{p(1-\alpha \beta l)}\right)^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}} \frac{Z \alpha \beta(1-p)}{[(1-
    \alpha \beta l)]} \label{eq32}
\end{align}
Given that the partial derivatives in equation \ref{eq32} are positive, it's clear that monitoring costs (\(1-\mu\))
diminish the steady-state level of capital, and this effect intensifies with increased productivity. Hence, firms with
higher productivity face greater adverse impacts from monitoring costs. A potential rationale for this phenomenon is
that, typically, more productive firms could negotiate lower interest rates due to their ability to present higher
outputs as collateral to financial intermediaries in case of default. However, monitoring costs erode this advantage. In
situations where monitoring costs reach 100\%, the differential impact on firms of varying productivity levels
disappears, as monitoring costs uniformly affect all firms. 

Another interesting aspect to explore is the effect on the steady-state level of capital when there is an increase in
the leverage ratio. To investigate this, we consider the derivative of \(\hat{k}\) with respect to leverage (\(l\)),
under the assumption that \(p = R_f l / (1 - \delta)\). 

\begin{align}
    % First equation part
    &\frac{\partial \hat{k}}{\partial l} = \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \left( \frac{Z\alpha\beta(p(1-\mu) + \mu)}{p(1-\alpha \beta l)} \right)^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}} \nonumber \\
    % Second equation part, split for clarity
    &\left( \frac{Z\alpha \beta (1-\mu)p^{\prime}p(1-\alpha \beta l) - (p^{\prime}(1-\alpha \beta l)+p \alpha \beta)Z\alpha\beta(p(1-\mu) + \mu)}{(p(1-\alpha \beta l))^2} \right)\nonumber \\
    % Third equation part
    &\frac{\partial \hat{k}}{\partial l} = \frac{1}{1-\alpha} \left( \frac{Z\alpha\beta(R_f l (1-\delta)^{-1}(1-\mu) + \mu)}{R_f l (1-\delta)^{-1}(1-\alpha \beta l)} \right)^{\frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha}} \cdot \nonumber \\
    % Third equation continued, with clearer structure
    & \Bigl( -\frac{(1-\delta)\mu +  \alpha \beta Z R_f (1-\mu) l}{R_f l^2 (1- \alpha \beta l)} \nonumber \\
    & +\frac{\alpha \beta (1-\delta)\mu + \alpha^2\beta^2 R_f(1-\mu)Z l}{R_f l (1- \alpha \beta l)^2} +\frac{\alpha \beta Z (1-\mu)}{ l (1- \alpha \beta l)} \Bigr) \label{eq34}
\end{align}
The determination of whether the partial derivative mentioned in equation \ref{eq34} is positive primarily hinges on the second term of the derivative. To clarify, we can state the condition for the partial derivative to be positive as follows:
\begin{align}
    &l (\alpha \beta (1-\delta)\mu + \alpha^2\beta^2 R_f(1-\mu)Z l) + \alpha \beta Z (1-\mu) \geq \nonumber\\
    &((1-\delta)\mu +  \alpha \beta Z R_f (1-\mu) l) (1- \alpha \beta l) \label{eq35}
\end{align}
If the condition outlined in equation \ref{eq35} is satisfied, then increasing leverage will actually increase the
steady-state level of capital. This might seem unexpected because typically, higher leverage means a higher risk of
default. However, if the assumption (\(p-\delta p - R_f l=0\)) and condition \ref{eq35} hold, it suggests that the chance of default decreases enough with increased
leverage to lower the interest rate, which compensates for the typical rise in interest rates seen with higher leverage.
This balancing act continues only up to a certain point of leverage; beyond this, the detrimental effects of additional
leverage surpasses the benefits, resulting in a decrease in steady-state capital. 

The graph referenced as \ref{plot_part} displays this interesting dynamic. For lower levels of leverage, the impact on
steady-state capital is positive, which aligns with the condition being met. As leverage increases beyond this favorable
range, the graph shows that the partial derivative becomes negative, which means that more leverage reduces the capital
level. This dynamic is captured in the graph where, below a leverage point around 0.1, leverage has a positive effect on
capital, skyrocketing as it approaches zero.

        \(\beta=0.956\), \(\delta =0.07\), and \(Z=1\). It can be observed that when the leverage is greater than 0.1,
        the partial derivative becomes negative, signifying that an increase in leverage results in a decrease in
        steady-state capital. Conversely, when the leverage is below this threshold, the partial derivative sharply
        rises towards \(+\infty\). }
    \label{plot_part}
\end{figure}

Finally, we can derive the optimal trajectories for capital and dividends, as well as the steady-state locus for capital in the
context of no debt and financial friction (assuming \(l = 0\), \(\mu = 1\), and \(p = 1\)), the following expressions
are obtained:
\begin{align}
    k_1 &= Z k_0^{\alpha}\alpha\beta, \\
    d^*_0 &= Z k_0^{\alpha}(1-\alpha\beta), \\
    \hat{k} &= \left[Z \alpha \beta \right]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}.
\end{align}
In conclusion, the optimal capital and dividend paths have been derived under specific financial conditions. Key
assumptions, particularly \( p - \delta p - R_f l = 0 \), critically simplify the dynamics, implying that the net effect
of the discount rate, the probability of repayment, and the cost of debt on capital growth is neutral. This assumption
allows for a direct relationship between the capital level and the dividend policy, as depicted by the transition and
policy functions. The closed-form expressions for \( k_1 \), \( d_1 \), and \( \hat{k} \) emphasize the steady-state
capital level's sensitivity to these parameters, underscoring the pivotal role of \( p \) in shaping the firm's
financial trajectory. Under the no-debt and no-financial-friction scenario (\( l = 0 \), \( \mu = 1 \), \( p = 1 \)),
the model further reflects how the absence of these frictions leads to straightforward growth dynamics, reinforcing the
importance of these financial parameters in determining the firm's optimal strategies. 



\section{Monte Carlo Simulations}

To explore the distinctions between scenarios with and without financial frictions, we conduct a simulation exercise
employing  parameters similar to those used in the \cite{OsePap17} study:

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{lcc}
    \hline Parameter & Symbol & Value \\
    \hline \hline
    Discount factor & $\beta$ & 0.956 \\
    Risk-free rate & $R_f$ & 1.04 \\
    Depreciation rate & $\delta$ & 0.07 \\
    Returns to scale & $\alpha$ & 0.70 \\
    Firm productivity & $Z$ & 1 \\
    \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Benchmark calibration}
\end{table}


This section presents a simulation study to compare scenarios with and without financial frictions, employing parameters
from the \cite{OsePap17} study. The simulation explores the effects of financial frictions by setting different
monitoring costs for two firms, with firm 0 facing no monitoring cost and firm 1 experiencing a monitoring cost of
25\%\(\mu =0.75 \).
The key assumption for the simulation is \( p - \delta p - R_f l = 0 \), leading to a calculated probability of
repayment (\(p\)) of approximately 0.559 for both firms.

    \caption{The graph illustrates the optimal trajectory for capital as defined by equation \ref{eq29}. It features a
    red line that remains above the blue line across all periods, symbolizing the optimal capital path towards the
    steady state in the absence of monitoring costs. Conversely, the blue line delineates the optimal path for firms
    subjected to a 25\% monitoring cost. Apart from the monitoring cost, all other parameters are held constant. It is
    evident from the graph that monitoring costs have a significant impact on the steady state, notably reducing it.
    }
    \label{fig:capitalEvolution}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:capitalEvolution} explicitly demonstrates the impact of monitoring costs on reducing the steady-state
capital level. The observed discrepancy in steady-state capital levels between the two firms is quantified as follows:
\begin{align*}
    &\hat{k_0} = 7.077, \\
    &\hat{k_1} = 2.713, \\
    &\Delta\hat{k} = \hat{k_0} - \hat{k_1} = 4.364.
\end{align*}
Hence, imposing a 25\% monitoring cost on the output, under a fixed leverage ratio of 0.5, results in a 69\% reduction
in the steady-state level of capital.

Additionally, Figure \ref{fig:dividendsEvolution} illustrates the optimal dividend paths for the same two firms, one
burdened by monitoring costs and the other not. Following the policy function detailed in \ref{eq31}, derived from
the solution to the Bellman equation.

    \caption{The figure illustrates the optimal trajectory of dividends as derived from equation \ref{eq31}. Here, the
    red line, consistently above the blue across all periods, indicates the optimal progression toward the steady-state
    level when monitoring costs are not factored in. In contrast, the blue line represents the trajectory under the
    influence of a 25\% monitoring cost. With all other parameters held constant, it is evident that monitoring costs
    exert a downward pressure on the steady-state level of dividends.}
    \label{fig:dividendsEvolution}
\end{figure}

In the \ref{fig:dividendsEvolution} The dividend trajectory is notably higher in scenarios without financial frictions, emphasizing the significant role
these frictions play in reducing returns. In a steady-state analysis, monitoring costs lead to a 78\% decrease in
dividend levels, given a constant leverage ratio of 0.5. 
In the forthcoming sections, the analysis will expand to simulate an economy with heterogeneous agents, aiming to
dissect the broader implications of financial frictions on overall output. This simulation will contrast environments
with and without financial frictions, with a particular focus on the cleansing effect that such frictions may exert in
economic systems. Through this comparative approach, we aim to deepen the understanding of how financial frictions
influence economic resilience, performance, and the potential for innovation and growth amidst challenges. 
Next, we will simulate an economy with heterogeneous agents to assess the overall output in environments with and
without financial frictions. This analysis aims to explore the cleansing effect of financial frictions, providing
insights into their influence on economic performance and growth potential.

\subsection{Heterogeneity and Aggregation Mechanism}

To refine the model, we introduce heterogeneity among firms, marking a departure from uniform productivity.
Specifically, productivity levels (\( Z_i \)) now vary across firms, introducing a spectrum of efficiency within
the model. Additionally, we diversify leverage ratios, ensuring no direct correlation between a firm's productivity and
its leverage. This heterogeneity is captured from the outset by simulating the initial distribution of capital,
leverage, and productivity, setting the stage for a dynamic interplay of firm characteristics. The aggregate output at
time t for a population of N firms
is :
\begin{equation}
    K_t = \sum_{i=0}^{N}{Z_{i,t}k_{i,t^\alpha}} \label{eq:K_bar}
\end{equation}
The business cycle is modeled through a sine function, impacting the productivity factor \(Z\) uniformly across all
firms in the economy. Furthermore, the maximum influence the business cycles can exert on productivity is limited to 10\%
of \(Z\). Consequently, the cycle is represented as follows: 
\begin{equation}
    \Delta Z_t = 1 + 0.1 \sin(t) \label{eq:bc}
\end{equation}
The firm determines an optimal level of output at time \(t_0\) for the subsequent time \(t_1\), based on equation
\ref{eq29}. However, the actual output may deviate from this optimal level due to fluctuations in the productivity
factor \(Z\), which is influenced by the business cycle, as described in Equation \ref{eq:bc}. To differentiate
between these two scenarios, the term 'optimal' will refer to the firm's chosen level of output, while 'actual' will
describe the output level that the firm ultimately achieves. 

Productivity (\(Z\)) and leverage (\(l\)) follow truncated normal distributions:
\begin{align}
    l &\sim \mathcal{N}(0.05, 0.1), & 0.01 \leq l \leq 1, \\
    Z-1 &\sim \mathcal{N}(0.5, 0.1), & 1.01 \leq Z \leq 1.1.
\end{align}


The exit mechanism for firms in this model is based on criteria where a firm's exit is contingent on its return on
capital being below the risk-free rate and also being among the lowest two within the entire firm population. This
approach ensures that at each evaluation point, the potential for market exit is limited to the two firms with the least
efficient capital utilization, provided their returns are less than the risk-free rate. Consequently, this mechanism
inherently caps the maximum proportion of firms that can exit the market at any given time to prevent unrealistic,
explosive market dynamics.

By introducing a natural cap that theoretically limits maximum exits to 20\% of the firm population, the market
maintains a dynamic equilibrium, facilitating the exit of the least productive firms and preventing scenarios where
excessive market exits lead to implausible economic conditions.

For a firm \(i\) at time \(t\), the return on capital is calculated as follows:
\begin{equation}
    R_{i,t} = \frac{d_{i,t-1}}{k_{i,t}} + \frac{k_{i,t}-k_{i,t-1}}{k_{i,t}} 
\end{equation}

A firm is mandated to exit the market if its return on capital ranks among the lowest two and falls below the risk-free
rate (\(R_f\)). This criterion is applied systematically at each simulation step, aligning the market's evolutionary
process with economic efficiency principles.\footnote{The exit criteria, focusing on the two lowest returns below the
risk-free rate, are assessed at each step of the simulation to identify firms for market exit.} Through this mechanism,
the model illustrates a market that rewards efficiency while ensuring a balanced impact of exits on the economic
landscape. 


\subsection{Findings}

In the presented investigation, financial frictions are integrated into the economic model, characterized by a monitoring cost
parameter \(1-\mu = 0.15\). The aim is to discern the repercussions of such frictions on the economic dynamics. To this
end, we conduct two distinct simulations within the environment of financial frictions: one where an economy is subject
to an exit and capital reallocation mechanism, and another where this mechanism is absent, inhibiting the movement of
capital. 

The analysis is robust, comprising 100 Monte Carlo simulations to determine the sample mean and variance of each
variable. Central to our inquiry is whether a recession induces a 'cleansing effect,' wherein less efficient firms exit
the market, leading to a potential increase in aggregate productivity. Accordingly, we simulate two economic setups: one
where firms operate without an enforced exit, and another where firms are mandated to exit under certain conditions. In
both setups, firms face financial frictions manifested as monitoring costs, consistent with \(1-\mu=0.15\). The ensuing figures present the sample mean and 95\%
confidence intervals for total output, comparing scenarios where exits are permitted to those where no reallocation
occurs.

Visual representation (\ref{fig:optKnoE}) of total output over a 20-step horizon, including 100 iterations among a group of 10 firms,
illustrates the comparative trajectories. Under financial frictions, the economy with the exit mechanism in play
consistently registers a superior aggregate output level. This finding corroborates the notion of a market-driven
'cleansing effect'â€”the process through which less productive firms are culled, freeing up resources for redistribution
to more efficient entities. Notably, this effect is not merely sustained amidst financial frictions; it is measurably
impactful, enhancing production output. This observed phenomenon underscores the potential for policy-driven capital
reallocation mechanisms to bolster economic efficiency, even when financial barriers are present.

    \caption{The plot presents the outcomes of a 20-step simulation involving 10 firms, contrasting the total output
    (\(K\)) in an economy with an exit and reallocation mechanism (red line) against an economy lacking such mechanisms
    (blue line). Both scenarios are subject to 15\% monitoring costs and experience a sinusoidal continuous shock
    affecting productivity. The visualization illustrates that the incorporation of exit and reallocation strategies
    enhances the overall output of the economy despite the presence of financial frictions. Given that the total number
    of firms is held constant at ten, the aggregate production can be interpreted as average productivity by dividing by
    ten. The data suggest the presence of a cleansing effect within the economy, even when financial frictions are
    factored in. The confidence intervals are depicted at a 95\% level, derived from 100 Monte Carlo simulation
    iterations.}

The presence of a forced reallocation mechanism contributes to a higher overall capital (\(k\)) at each step,
substantiating the notion that a cleansing effect persists even amidst financial frictions, resulting in greater
production compared to scenarios where firms are barred from exiting. Evidently, these variations in overall capital are
markedly pro-cyclical, aligning with the findings in \cite{DavHalt92}.
In the subsequent figure \ref{fig:output_comparison_frictions}, we delve into the nuances of this impact by examining the mean log difference in total
production between the two scenarios, accompanied by a 95\% confidence interval.  The data underscores a positive and
a statistically significant difference in overall output, indicative of the beneficial role played by the exit mechanism
in the context of financial frictions. This effect echoes the theoretical insights discussed earlier, where the exit
mechanism serves as a pivotal driver of economic efficiency and productivity.

    is depicted by the difference between these lines. In the absence of monitoring costs, the cleansing effect results

Graph \ref{fig:output_comparison_frictions} illustrates the effect of firm exits and capital reallocation on total output in two different economic
scenarios, factoring in the impact of monitoring costs. The red line represents economies with monitoring costs equating
to 15\% of recoverable assets (\(1-\mu=0.15\)), while the blue line depicts economies without any monitoring costs
(\(1-\mu=0\)). The contrast between the two lines showcases the 'cleansing effect' of firm exits: in the absence of
monitoring costs, this effect prompts a 20\% rise in output, whereas, with monitoring costs, the output boost is more
modest, at about 7\%. The error bars on the graph denote a 95\% confidence interval, affirming the statistical
significance of the results. 

Figure \ref{fig:output_comparison_frictions} affirms that capital reallocation following firm exits can enhance
productivity, even under financial constraints represented by a 15\% monitoring cost. Despite the asymmetric information
challenges between financial intermediaries and firms, the positive impact on production is not only present but also
accumulates over time, suggesting a magnifying effect. Therefore, two otherwise identical economies in terms of
productivity and capital distribution will ultimately diverge in output if one incorporates the mechanism of firm exits
and capital reallocation, despite the existence of financial frictions.
